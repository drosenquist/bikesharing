The majority of users are male subscribers. The most popular time for users to use CitiBike was during the weekday commuting hours, 8 a.m. and between 5-6 p.m. On the weekends, the bikes were used most often starting mid-morning and continuting through the afternoon. Additional visuations that might be helpful would be maping starting and ending locations to better to place bikes in high usage areas and indicate where bikes are most likely to be for picking them up to service.
